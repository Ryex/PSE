# Difficulties

## Prior Experience
  
In addition to never have designed a game before, most group members have also never touched the Unity game engine.
  
## 'Rona
    
The introduction of COVID-19 made it impossible to meet in person to complete this assignment, in addition to yielding unforseen consequences with living situations. Because of this, we would be restricted to finding a time to meet virtually, which is also difficult due to the unreliability of internet in Socorro.
